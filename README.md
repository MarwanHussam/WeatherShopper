WeatherShopper

DESCRIPTION:
This is an automation project made using selenium on java, the main aim is to visit a website that sells Sunscreens and Moisturizers depending on the temperature.

STEPS:
You can see on the first webpage a random temperature is generated and depending on that temperature you are redirected to the respective webpage. if the temperature is less than "19°C" you will be visiting the
Moisturizers webpage. However, if the temperature is greater than "34°C" you will need a Sunscreen instead. When in Moisturizers page, their will be two kinds of moisturizers (Aloe and Almond) the least expensive
from each kind will be added to the Cart. Same thing happens in the Sunscreens webpage, except that their will be three kind of sunscreens (SPF-30, SPF-40 and SPF-50). We will deal only with the SPF-30 and SPF-50
sunscreens. After that we will visit the Cart and pay after filling the necessary information.

Getting Started:
All you need to do is run the code on an IDE and see the magic happens.
